CricketGameVR
======
A game that integrates the experience of playing cricket with the atmosphere and celebration of holi. Created as a group project for the class Alternate Realities at NYU Abu Dhabi.

#### Game Prototype Made By:
* Faizan Haider
* Manas Pant
* Navya Suri
* Shantanu Bhatia



#### Issues identified from feedback:
* Lacks any UI
* Focuses too hard on the "cricket" and not enough on the "holi." While it is mechanically reasonably sound, it doesn't feel like it has anything to do with Holi beyond the lone colour-splashy mechanic. Feels empty. 
* Could use a little more personality in its environment in general
* Graphically, scale is currently pretty far out.
